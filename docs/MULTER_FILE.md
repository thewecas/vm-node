## File Upload and Handling in Express.js using Multer

### Introduction

Multer is a popular middleware for handling multipart/form-data requests, which are used for sending files in forms. It simplifies the process of uploading files in Node.js applications built with Express.js. This documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up and use Multer for file uploads.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
- **Express.js**: Install Express.js using npm or yarn.
- **Multer**: Install Multer using npm or yarn.

```bash
npm install express multer
```

### Step 1: Setting Up the Express Server

First, create a basic Express server:

```javascript
// server.js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

### Step 2: Configuring Multer

To handle file uploads, you need to configure Multer. Here's how you can set it up:

```javascript
// upload.js
const multer = require("multer");

// Set up storage for uploaded files
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, "./uploads/");
  },
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, Date.now() + "-" + file.originalname);
  },
});

// Create an instance of Multer with the storage configuration
const upload = multer({ storage: storage });

module.exports = upload;
```

### Step 3: Handling File Uploads

Now, integrate Multer into your Express routes to handle file uploads:

```javascript
// server.js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const upload = require("./upload");

// Route for single file upload
app.post("/upload/single", upload.single("file"), (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.file);
  res.json({ message: "File uploaded successfully!" });
});

// Route for multiple file uploads
app.post("/upload/multiple", upload.array("files", 10), (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.files);
  res.json({ message: "Files uploaded successfully!" });
});
```

### Step 4: Creating an HTML Form for File Upload

Create an HTML form to test the file upload functionality:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>File Upload</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form action="/upload/single" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <input type="file" name="file" />
      <button type="submit">Upload Single File</button>
    </form>

    <form action="/upload/multiple" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <input type="file" name="files" multiple />
      <button type="submit">Upload Multiple Files</button>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Step 5: Serving Static Files

To serve the HTML form, you can use Express's static file serving capability:

```javascript
// server.js
app.use(express.static("public")); // Assuming index.html is in the public folder
```

### Error Handling

Multer automatically passes errors to Express's error handling middleware. You can handle errors by setting up an error handler:

```javascript
// server.js
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  if (err instanceof multer.MulterError) {
    res.status(500).send({ message: "Error uploading file" });
  } else {
    next(err);
  }
});
```

### Conclusion

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of using Multer with Express.js for file uploads. By following these steps, you can efficiently handle file uploads in your Node.js applications.

### Additional Tips

- **File Filtering**: Use Multer's `fileFilter` option to filter files based on MIME types or extensions.
- **Memory Storage**: Use `multer.memoryStorage()` to store files in memory instead of disk.
- **Cloud Storage**: Consider integrating with cloud storage services like AWS S3 for scalable file storage.
